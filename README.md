## Getting Started

1. **Setup:**
   - You can either clone this repository directly to Puhti or download the zip file and move it to your desired location, such as `/projappl/project_id/username/` or `/scratch/project_id/username/`. To clone the repository directly, first run `module load git` to load the Git module.
   - Note that the tutorial includes images stored in the `/pics-` folder, so the `.ipynb` file alone will not function correctly without these images.

2. **Jupyter App Configuration:**
   When starting the Jupyter app in Puhti, ensure the following settings:
     - Select the appropriate project.
     - Increase the memory allocation to 5 GB for smooth execution of example codes.
     - Use the `tensorflow` module.
     - Verify that your working directory is set to the location where you moved the repository.
