## Getting Started

1. **Setup:**
   - Clone this repository or download the zip file, then move it to your desired location in Puhti, such as `/projappl/project_id/username/` or `/scratch/project_id/username/`.
   - Note that the tutorial includes images stored in the `/pics-` folder, so the `.ipynb` file alone will not function correctly without these images.

2. **Jupyter App Configuration:**
   When starting the Jupyter app in Puhti, ensure the following settings:
     - Select the appropriate project.
     - Increase the memory allocation to 5 GB for smooth execution of example codes.
     - Use the `tensorflow` module.
     - Verify that your working directory is set to the location where you moved the repository.

3. **Timing:**
   - Set a timer or track the time in another way before you begin. As you work through the tutorial, consider the following questions and take notes:

### 1. Clarity & Usability
   - Were the instructions for setting up Jupyter and MLflow on Puhti clear? Did you encounter any specific points of confusion?
   - Was the tutorial easy to follow step-by-step? If not, where did you face difficulties?

### 2. Technical Content
   - Did the tutorial provide sufficient background on MLflow concepts?
   - Were there any assumptions about prior knowledge that should have been explained more thoroughly?
   - Was the example code documented appropriately? Was there too much or too little documentation?

### 3. Error Handling
   - Did you encounter any errors while running the code? If so, how did you resolve them?

### 4. Results
   - Were the results (parameters, metrics) from MLflow tracking clear and understandable?
   - Was it easy to compare and analyze the performance of different models according to the instructions?

### 5. Suggestions for Improvement
   - What improvements or additional information would enhance the tutorialâ€™s usefulness?
   - Was there any expected feature that was missing, or something included that seemed irrelevant?

### 6. Time & Effort
   - How long did it take to complete the tutorial? Was the duration appropriate for the content covered?

### 7. General Feedback
   - How would you rate the overall quality of the tutorial?
   - Would you recommend this tutorial to others? Why or why not?
